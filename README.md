All these files were created from scratch, but out of respect for Phil I wanted to GPLv3 the project. 

Thanks to Phil for the staggering measurements from the atreus, and profet23 for the 62 key variant. 

This project uses MIT licensed KiCad footprints from Keebio and the Lily58 project.

### Goals: 
- Design reversible pcb with onboard atmega32u4 and low profile trrs.

### Known issues:
- SMD Diode footprint is only on the back-copper layer, so diodes have to be mounted on the bottom of the left half and the top of the right half.
