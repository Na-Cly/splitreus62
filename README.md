# splitreus62 Rev 1.b

- [Atreus](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus) Phil Hagelberg
- [Atreus62](https://github.com/profet23/atreus62) Profet23

All these files were created from scratch, but out of respect for Phil I wanted to GPLv3 the project. 

Thanks to Phil for the staggering measurements from the atreus, and profet23 for the 62 key variant. 

This project uses MIT licensed KiCad footprints from Keebio and the Lily58 project.
